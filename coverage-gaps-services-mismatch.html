      </div>

      <h1>Your Policy Covers "IT Consulting" &mdash; You Do Security Services</h1>
      <p class="cg-intro">
        The most common coverage gap I see in MSP policies: the professional services definition doesn't match the services you deliver.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Your Tech E&O policy has a "Professional Services" definition. It's usually on the declarations page or in a schedule. It describes the work your policy covers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most managed service providers, it says something like "information technology consulting services" or "computer consulting and support." That definition was written for break-fix IT shops in 2010.
      </p>
      <p>If you do any of the following, your policy may not cover it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Managed security services</li>
        <li>Penetration testing or vulnerability assessments</li>
        <li>Incident response</li>
        <li>Cloud migrations</li>
        <li>vCISO or security advisory work</li>
        <li>Compliance assessments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The carrier doesn't need to prove you did something wrong. They just need to show the service wasn't listed. If it's not in the definition, they argue it's not covered.
      </p>

      <h2>Where This Gap Hides in Policy Language</h2>
      <p>
        Look at your Tech E&O declarations page. Find the definition for "Professional Services" or "Covered Services". It's usually one paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>Here's what a typical definition looks like:</p>
      <div class="policy-quote">
        "Professional Services means information technology consulting, network design and installation, software development, and related technical support services as described in the application."
      </div>
      <p>
        Notice what's missing: no mention of security testing, incident response, managed detection, or cloud services.
      </p>
      <p>Some policies add:</p>
      <div class="policy-quote">
        "as described in the application."
      </div>
      <p>
        This ties coverage to whatever you wrote on the original application. If you added pen testing after you applied, it may not be covered even if you told your broker.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pen testing gap is particularly dangerous. Pen testing is intentional by design: you're deliberately trying to break into systems. Most policies have an "intentional acts" exclusion. Without a specific carve-out for "authorized security testing," the carrier can argue your pen test is an excluded intentional act. You authorized the test. The damage was intentional. Claim denied.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>

      <div class="cg-scenario">
        <h3>Scenario 1: Managed security failure</h3>
        <p>You manage EDR for a client. An attacker bypasses the tool and encrypts their network. Client sues you for negligence. Your carrier reviews the claim, checks the professional services definition in your Tech E&O policy, and finds "IT consulting and network support." No mention of managed security or EDR management. They deny the claim. You're covering legal defense out of pocket.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="cg-scenario">
        <h3>Scenario 2: Pen test goes wrong</h3>
        <p>Your team runs an authorized pen test on a client's production environment. Something breaks. Client's e-commerce platform goes down for 24 hours. They claim $200K in lost revenue. Your carrier invokes the intentional acts exclusion: you intentionally attempted to compromise the system. Without a pen testing carve-out, they deny coverage.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="cg-scenario">
        <h3>Scenario 3: Cloud migration failure</h3>
        <p>You migrate a client from on-prem Exchange to Microsoft 365. Data loss during migration wipes three months of email archives. Client sues you. Your policy covers "network installation and technical support." But cloud migration isn't network installation. Carrier disputes the claim.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>How to Fix This</h2>

      <div class="cg-steps">
        <div class="cg-step">
          <p><strong>1. Pull your Tech E&O policy and go to the declarations page.</strong> Find the Professional Services definition. Read it word for word. Does it describe what you do today, not what you did when you first applied?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cg-step">
          <p><strong>2. Compare the Professional Services definition to your service catalog.</strong> List every service you sell. Check each one against the definition. If it's not there, it's a gap.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cg-step">
          <p><strong>3. Ask about pen testing specifically.</strong> If you do any security testing, check for an intentional acts carve-out. The phrase you are looking for: "authorized security testing" or "penetration testing performed with written client consent."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cg-step">
          <p><strong>4. Update the definition, if needed.</strong> Your broker can request an endorsement from your carrier to expand the professional services definition. This is usually straightforward and sometimes costs nothing. The key is asking before you need it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cg-step">
          <p><strong>5. Review after adding new services.</strong> Every time you add a service line, e.g., vCISO, compliance, IR retainers, check whether your policy definition covers it. Don't assume your broker updated it.</p>
