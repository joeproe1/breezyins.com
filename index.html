      <h1>I Help Managed Service Providers Find Out What Their Insurance Actually Covers</h1>

      <p class="hero-subheadline">
        Your MSP has grown past basic IT support, but your insurance hasn't kept up. Your contracts promise things your coverage won't back up. I audit both sides so you know exactly where you stand.

      <h2>Three Ways MSP Insurance Fails</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="problem-grid">
      <div class="problem-card">
        <h3>"Lost the enterprise deal"</h3>
        <p>Fortune 500 prospect requires proof of $5M cyber coverage. Your policy tops out at $2M.<br>Deal dies in procurement.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="problem-card">
        <h3>"Sued after a ransomware incident"</h3>
        <p>Client's network encrypted after your remote access was compromised. Your carrier says it's a cyber claim. Cyber carrier says it's a professional services claim.<br>You're stuck with legal bills.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="problem-card">
        <h3>"Broker sold you the wrong coverage"</h3>
        <p>You told your broker you do pen testing and incident response. They quoted 'IT consulting' and excluded security services.<br>You find out when you file a claim.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="stat-footer">
      These coverage gaps hide in policy language and surface during <strong>contract reviews</strong> or <strong>claims</strong>. By then it's too late to fix them.

      <h2>What a Policy Audit Tells You</h2>

        Most MSP insurance was written for basic IT support, not security services, cloud migrations, or incident response. A Risk Intelligence Report reviews your Tech E&O, Cyber, and client contracts side by side. You'll see exactly where the gaps are, what will be disputed, and what won't pay at all.

      <h2>Why Breezy Risk Advisors</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="section-narrow">
      <p class="section-body">
        I started Breezy because growing MSPs deserve someone who understands their business. You're adding service lines, signing bigger contracts, maybe acquiring other firms. Your broker still classifies you as 'IT consulting' and moves on. They don't know the difference between managed services and security assessments, and they don't read the contracts you're signing with clients.
      </p>

      <p class="section-body">
        I've spent 20+ years in insurance at carriers (CNA, Chubb) and a cyber insurance MGA. Before insurance, I worked in cybersecurity at Siemens. I read policy language for a living, and I understand the technical work your team does.
