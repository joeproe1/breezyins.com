        Most MSP insurance policies were written for basic IT support, not security services, cloud migrations, or incident response. The gaps show up when you're signing a contract or filing a claim.

        Use the Coverage Gaps Framework to identify common patterns, then request a Risk Intelligence Report to validate your specific policies.

        Most brokers quote 'IT consulting' policies that exclude the actual services you perform. I spent 20 years in insurance at carriers like CNA and Chubb, and started my career in cybersecurity at Siemens. I know how both sides work, and where the gaps are.
