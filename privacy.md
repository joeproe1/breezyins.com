- **Risk Documentation:** Existing insurance policies (including Tech E&O and Cyber Insurance), claims history, and Master Service Agreements (MSAs).
- **Sensitive Information:** We may collect proprietary details regarding your technology stack, intellectual property, and operational workflows to quantify your exact exposure in dollars.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- Analyze your company's risk exposure and identify gaps in penetration testing or client breach coverage.
- Negotiate insurance terms with third-party underwriters and carriers.

You may request to review, update, or delete your professional information at any time. However, please note that certain data must be retained for legal and compliance purposes as dictated by insurance regulations.
